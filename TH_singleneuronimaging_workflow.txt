To image single neurons and analyze data, workflow is usually as follows

1) Place Tiff file and temperature .txt and .txt.config.txt file in one folder, with same file name.

2) Run "AnalyzeAWCGCaMP" or "FRETanalysis_100110", depending on whether fluorescent imaging is GCaMP or FRET-based.

3) Those codes export .mat files, if baseline correction is needed run "baseline_correct_universal", if not then raw .mat file can be used.

4) Pile up baseline corrected or uncorrected .mat files into one folder, for average trace run "display_avg_calcium_data". for Tstar, run "find_T_star_linear" or "find_T_star_oscillation", depending on temperature ramp used.

5) Both scripts export a "T_star_numbers.mat" file, run "data_mean_sem_calc_T_star" for detailed information.
